I Graduated in Chemical Science and Biology from the Autonomous University of Nayarit, and I hold a master's degree in Sciences (Biology) from the University of Guanajuato. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Guanajuato.

I use R for statistical analysis and visualization of biological data.

I have a PhD in Physics from the University of Guanajuato, a Master's in Applied Sciences, and mechanical engineering training. My line of research has been Condensed Soft Matter through statistical mechanics. I have worked in Soft Matter and Biophotoacoustics laboratories at the University of Guanajuato and performed molecular simulations. I continue to be an enthusiastic apprentice of R for experimental and simulation data analysis.

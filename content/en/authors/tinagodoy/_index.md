I am the Head of the Department of Bioinformatics in Infectious Diseases at the [National Institute of Public Health](https://www.insp.mx/) in Mexico, which provides transversal support in the fields of massive sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to the researchers. My lines of research are the analysis of the repertoire of antibodies in health, disease, and vaccination conditions, the comparative genomics of clinical isolates of importance in public health, and Metagenomics applied to infectious diseases. During my Ph.D., I was part of the development of [ImmunediveRsity](https://bitbucket.org/ImmunediveRsity/immunediversity/src/master/), a specialized software for antibody sequences analysis.

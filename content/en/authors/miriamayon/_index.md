I am a professor at the Autonomous University of Nayarit. My interest is focused on evaluating genetic biomarkers in chronic degenerative diseases such as NGLDE and MTD2 and genetic markers in breast cancer. 

Using R Studio has allowed me to perform statistical analysis of the data obtained and create graphs to interpret project results.

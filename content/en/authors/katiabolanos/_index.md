I am a Biologist graduated from the Faculty of Sciences UNAM and currently do my master’s degree at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur Unidad Villahermosa.

My research area has been focused on population genetics and molecular evolution in bats. Recently, I integrated the conservation genomics approach and bioinformatics tools to gain a better understanding of species evolutionary processes over time. 

Interests:
- Population genetics
- Conservation Genomics
- Small mammals (bats, rodents and shrews)
- Molecular evolution
- Bioinformatics
- Data analysis

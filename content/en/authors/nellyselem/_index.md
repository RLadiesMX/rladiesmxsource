I am a professor at the [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://matmor.unam.mx/es) in  UNAM in Morelia. I earned a degree in Mathematics from the [University of Guanajuato](https://www.ugto.mx/) and a master’s degree by [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/). Then, I did a Ph.D. and a Post-doctorate in Integrative Biology at [Evolution of Metabolic Diversity lab](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/Dr-Francisco-Barona) at [Langebio-Cinvestav](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/). 

I care about teaching, I have taught at main México Universities: UNAM, ITESM, IPN, and CINVESTAV and I also developed open-source lessons for " [The Carpentries"](https://carpentries.org/). 

I'm a founder member of[ _BetterLab_](https://www.facebook.com/BetterLab-960854350785766/), a biotechnology and software startup, and I'm also a member of the Mexican SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Consortium. As a scientist, I have proposed and developed bioinformatics solutions to biological problems of comparative genomics of microorganisms. 

I am interested in the genome evolution of Archaea, Bacteria, and Fungi. For my work, I received the L'oréal award for women in science 2021. To me, everything is teamwork and that is what I expect from my students. Life-work balance it is important, family and social contribution matters to me. 

I like to skate and share, because of that I’m a member of the development program [Girls Hockey League](https://www.facebook.com/Girls-Hockey-League-M%C3%A9xico-104021021498610/) Mexico.

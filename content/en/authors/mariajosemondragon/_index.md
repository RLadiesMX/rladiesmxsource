I graduated from the Bachelor in Genomics at the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco and during my training I had the opportunity to learn about the programming language R. 

I attended the Diploma in Analysis and Interpretation of Biological Data where I gained more experience in the handling of bioinformatic packages to carry out DNA sequence readings and statistical analyses.

I graduated in Farmabiologist Chemistry from the Autonomous University of Nayarit, received a Master of Science in the Specialty of Plant Biotechnology from CINVESTAV-Langebio, and am currently pursuing a PhD at CINVESTAV-Irapuato Unit.

I use R for analyzing mass sequencing data, including genomes, metagenomes, and transcriptomes, as well as gene co-expression networks and statistical analysis.

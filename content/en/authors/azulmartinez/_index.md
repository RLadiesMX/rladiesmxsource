I have a degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Biologist, Master’s, and Doctorate of Sciences (Experimental Biology) from the University of Guanajuato. My professional background is in molecular biology, microbiology, and genetics of yeasts and filamentous fungi. I did a postdoctoral stay in Microbial Interactions at the CINVESTAV-Irapuato Unit. 

I am a research assistant at the Molecular Genetics of Fungi Laboratory, where I'm learning R for statistical analysis and data manipulation.

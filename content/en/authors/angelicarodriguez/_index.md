I currently work at the Autonomous University of Nayarit. My field of study is microbial resistance, with a special focus on the use of botanical extracts as therapeutic alternatives. I also work in health epidemiology to assess public health impacts and pharmacoepidemiology to investigate the use and effects of medicines on populations. 

I use R Studio as a key tool for statistical analysis and data visualization in my research. It allows me to perform complex analysis and statistical modeling and create custom graphs to interpret and present results effectively.
